Opus Matricus Fundamentus (WIP)

This repository eventually will contain a comprehensive library for representing and manipulating all algebraic numbers and some other mathematical objects using matrix techniques.

Current capabilities include:

* Integer square matrices with operator overrides for arithmetic.
* Fractional scaling to enable rational number matrices.
