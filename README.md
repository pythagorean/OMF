Opus Matricus Fundamentus (WIP)

This repository eventually will contain a comprehensive library for representing and manipulating all algebraic numbers and some other mathematical objects using matrix techniques.

Current capabilities include:

* Fractional scaled integer square matrices with rational valued arithmetic operations

* Matrions are partially implemented, a reduced, simplified matrix representation
  for algebraic numbers enabling concrete, finite numeric encoding of relationships
  typically considered irrational. Matrions can represent nth roots of any number.

  The stateful nature of Matrions makes them incredibly versatile for representing any
  phenomena that can be mathematically modeled. Some key strengths:

    * Matrices inherently capture multidimensional relationships.

    * State and history tracking allows reversible transforms.

    * Structure is preserved through reduction without loss.

    * Reduced forms enable compressing complexity.

    * Units and substances add physical semantics.
