Opus Matricus Fundamentus (WIP)

This repository eventually will contain a comprehensive library for representing and manipulating all algebraic numbers and some other mathematical objects using matrix techniques.

Current capabilities include:

* Fractional scaled integer square matrices with rational valued arithmetic operations
* Matrions are partially implemented, a reduced, simplified matrix representation
  for algebraic numbers enabling concrete, finite numeric encoding of relationships
  typically considered irrational. Matrions can represent nth roots of any number.
