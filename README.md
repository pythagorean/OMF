Opus Matricus Fundamentus (WIP)

Matrions are partially implemented, a reduced matrix representation for algebraic 
numbers enabling concrete, finite numeric encoding of relationships typically
considered irrational. Matrions can represent nth roots of any number.
  * State and history tracking allows reversible transforms.
  * Structure is preserved through reduction without loss.
  * Units and substances add physical semantics.
    
To start a session with Matrions enabled, run:
python -i matrion.py
